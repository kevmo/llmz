The GCP_CREDENTIALS variable holds the full path to the service account key\\'s JSON file. Adding the following line within the failed code block resolved the issue: os.environ[\\'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\\'] = os.environ.get(\\'GCP_CREDENTIALS\\').\\nThis occurs because the path to profiles.yml is not correctly specified. You can rectify this by:\\n“export DBT_PROFILES_DBT=path/to/profiles.yml”\\nEg., /home/src/magic-zoomcamp/dbt/project_name/\\nDo the similar for DBT_PROJECT_DIR if getting similar issue with dbt_project.yml.\\nOnce DIRs are set,:\\n“dbt debug –config-dir”\\nThis would update your paths. To maintain same path across sessions, use the path variables in your .env file.\\nTo add triggers in mage pipelines via CLI, you can create a trigger of type API, and copy the API links.\\nEg. link: http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/10/pipeline_runs/f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2\\nThen create a trigger.py as such:\\nimport os\\nimport requests\\nclass MageTrigger:\\nOPTIONS = {\\n\"<pipeline_name>\": {\\n\"trigger_id\": 10,\\n\"key\": \"f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2\"\\n}\\n}\\n@staticmethod\\ndef trigger_pipeline(pipeline_name, variables=None):\\ntrigger_id = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][\"trigger_id\"]\\nkey = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][\"key\"]\\nendpoint = f\"http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/{trigger_id}/pipeline_runs/{key}\"\\nheaders = {\\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'}\\npayload = {}\\nif variables is not None:\\npayload[\\'pipeline_run\\'] = {\\'variables\\': variables}\\nresponse = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)\\nreturn response\\nMageTrigger.trigger_pipeline(\"<pipeline_name>\")\\nFinally, after the mage server is up an running, simply this command:\\npython trigger.py from mage directory in terminal.\\nCan I do data partitioning & clustering run by dbt pipeline, or I would need to do this manually in BigQuery afterwards?\\nYou can use this configuration in your DBT model:\\n{\\n\"field\": \"<field name>\",\\n\"data_type\": \"<timestamp | date | datetime | int64>\",\\n\"granularity\": \"<hour | day | month | year>\"\\n# Only required if data_type is \"int64\"\\n\"range\": {\\n\"start\": <int>,\\n\"end\": <int>,\\n\"interval\": <int>\\n}\\n}\\nand for clustering\\n{{\\nconfig(\\nmaterialized = \"table\",\\ncluster_by = \"order_id\",\\n)\\n}}\\nmore details in: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs', 'section': 'Triggers in Mage via CLI', 'question': 'Encountering the error \"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \\'kafka.vendor.six.moves\\'\" when running \"from kafka import KafkaProducer\" in Jupyter Notebook for Module 6 Homework?'}, {'text': 'Docker Commands\\n# Create a Docker Image from a base image\\nDocker run -it ubuntu bash\\n#List docker images\\nDocker images list\\n#List  Running containers\\nDocker ps -a\\n#List with full container ids\\nDocker ps -a --no-trunc\\n#Add onto existing image to create new image\\nDocker commit -a <User_Name> -m \"Message\" container_id New_Image_Name\\n# Create a Docker Image with an entrypoint from a base image\\nDocker run -it --entry_point=bash python:3.11\\n#Attach to a stopped container\\nDocker start -ai <Container_Name>\\n#Attach to a running container\\ndocker exec -it <Container_ID> bash\\n#copying from host to container\\nDocker cp <SRC_PATH/file> <containerid>:<dest_path>\\n#copying from container to host\\nDocker cp <containerid>:<Srct_path> <Dest Path on host/file>\\n#Create an image from a docker file\\nDocker build -t <Image_Name> <Location of Dockerfile>\\n#DockerFile Options and best practices\\nhttps://devopscube.com/build-docker-image/\\n#Docker delete all images forcefully\\ndocker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)\\n#Docker delete all containers forcefully\\ndocker rm -f $(docker ps -qa)\\n#docker compose creation\\nhttps://www.composerize.com/\\nGCP Commands\\n1.
